1) The basics to prepare
- Debian 10 with Apache
- A fixed IP for your server
- Your user and password + that of root 

2) Install
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev ruby-dev nodejs bundler rubygems default-libmysqlclient-dev libmariadb-dev libjq-dev jq curl
- Then install Smashing (more informations: https://smashing.github.io/)
sudo gem install smashing

- Create dashboard
Run the following command:
smashing new dashboard 

- Once Smashing is correctly installed on your machine, you need to create our dashboard.
Go to the directory where you want to store your data for me it's direct in simpler home:

- And install ruby dependency
sudo gem install ruby-jq -- --use-system-libraries
cd dashboard
bundle
- It will take a few minutes. Once the installation is complete, you can launch Smashing via this command: 
smashing start
- Be careful, if you leave the terminal, Smashing will stop. You must leave this terminal open to be able to access your dashboard at the end of the tutorial, I will tell you how to leave it running in the background.
- Go to your browser and access the address of your machine followed by: 3030: http://IPOFDASHBOARD:3030.
By default, Smashing provides two dashboards: sample and sampletv.

- Now the folder of your new dashboard contains (!!!! FOR MODIFY THIS FILES DON'T USE ROOT)
assets  config.ru  dashboards  Gemfile  Gemfile.lock  history.yml  jobs  lib  public  README.md  widgets 

- Now we will create our basic dashboard
- ctrl + c to stop smashing
- Edit the file:
nano Gemfile

- Add at the end of the file if not present
gem 'curl'
gem 'ruby-jq'
gem 'json'

- ctrl + x to save then:
bundle
password root

- Modification of the size of the tiles:
in nano assets / javascripts / application.coffee
and modify it like this 
Dashing.on 'ready', ->
  Dashing.widget_margins ||= [8, 8]
  Dashing.widget_base_dimensions ||= [300, 500]

- Copy .erb file
in the dashboard folder and modify in file (if you want ex):
<% content_for :title do %>NAME OF DASHBOARD<% end %>
				^
<div data-id="cent" data-view="cent" data-title="NAME OF TILE"></div>
						  ^
3) Start Smashing
go to dashboard folder
smashing start -d
- Go to your browser and access the address of your machine followed by: 3030: http://IPOFDASHBOARD:3030.

To stop dashboard
go to dashboard folder
smashing stop
